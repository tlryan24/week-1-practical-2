    <h1>Exercise 5</h1>
    <p>Your sketch:</p>
    <div class="guidance">
        <h2>Guidance</h2>
        <div>
            <p>This is an open-ended exercise so there is no expected output or hints.
            </p>
            <p>Design and implement a character using p5.js's built-in primitive shapes. Your character can be anything you like (alien, monster, some sort of animal...) as long as it meets the following requirements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It must be drawn <strong>in the centre</strong> of an 800 by 800 pixel canvas and must take up no more space than 400 by 400 pixels. This is so you can animate it in a future practical. If you're having trouble getting your character perfectly in the centre, that's OK. Just make 
                sure there is a margin of about 200 pixels all the way around your character.</li>
                <li>Your character must have a face, arms, and/or legs.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Be creative in your use of shapes and colours. You are encouraged to use shapes listed under "2D Primitives" in <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/" target="_blank">the p5.js reference</a> that we haven't covered in class i.e. arcs, quads. Please don't try to use more complex shapes from other parts of p5.js (3D, PShape) just yet. The point of 
            this exercise is to get really comfortable with 2D primitive shapes.</p>
            <p>You will animate your character in a future practical.</p>
            <p>Here is my character, Robert the Robot. Robert is not very colourful. Try to be more colourful!</p>
