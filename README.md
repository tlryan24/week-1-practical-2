# PDM1 - Week 1 Practical 2

## Expectations for Practicals
The goal of these exercises is to help you practice and extend what you learn in lecture. You will probably find that you can't get through all the exercises during the practical session. It is expected that you finish any remaining exercises in your own time, ideally before the next lecture and certainly before the next practical session. To be successful in this module, aim to write as much code as you can! Completing all practical exercises is a great way to make sure you're getting enough coding practice.

In this module, the topics covered each week build directly upon the previous weeks' content. Therefore it is essential that you complete each week's assigned exercises before moving on to the next week.

I recommend having the slides from the lectures and [the p5.js reference](https://p5js.org/reference/) open while you work.

## Summary

This practical is split into four stages:
1. Edit and correct errors in existing code.
2. Basic use of shapes and greyscale colours.
3. The <code>rectMode()</code> function.
4. RGB and RGBA colours.
5. Putting it all together.


## Instructions
If you have not already done so, follow the steps given on the VLE in Week 1 Practical 1 (How to work on programming exercises) to create a new repo from this template and clone it to your computer.

**1: View the instructions for each exercise**

Each exercise in this practical has it's own folder in this repo. Within each folder, there is an HTML file with the exercise name e.g. exercise1-1.html. Open the HTML file in your web browser using the Live Preview extension in VS Code. Note: You can open HTML files directly (without Live Preview), but you will need to refresh the page manually each time you want to see an update. If you use Live Preview, the page will automatically refresh when you edit the code.

The instructions for the exercise are  in the HTML file, which will also show the output of your code when you view it in your browser.

**2: For each exercise, edit sketch.js in the exercise folder**

To complete an exercise, edit the file named sketch.js in the exercise folder. If you are using Live Preview, the HTML page for the exercise will automatically refresh to show your changes. If you are not using Live Preview, save your changes then refresh the page in your browser to view the updates. For example, if you are working on exercise1-1, you will edit sketch.js inside the exercise1-1 folder. You can view the output of your code by loading exercise1-1/exercise1-1.html in your browser.

If you are not seeing the output of your sketch, make sure you have edited the sketch.js file in the correct folder.

**3: Check your work using the "check" HTML file to verify your work, where applicable**

Many of the exercise folders contain an HTML file named "check-exerciseX-X.html", that will run a series of tests to automatically verify the output of the sketch. If a folder contains an HTML file beginning with "check", open it in your browser using Live Preview (or open it directly and hit refresh if you edit your code). The results of the tests will appear below your sketch output.

You can use these tests to double check your work, and get hints for anything you might be stuck on. The test results don't impact your module mark and you can run them as often as you like.

**4: When have finished working, commit your work using Github**

You can commit your work as often as you like--the practical doesn't have to be complete and you're able to make changes after you have committed (but don't forget to commit those changes too!).
